# Expert Trajectories for Gym Environments
Contains expert trajectories tailored for state-only imitation learning tasks in Gym environments. 

## What's State-Only Imitation Learning?
State-only imitation learning is all about mimicking the behavior of an expert using only the observations of the environment's states. It's like learning to dance by watching someone else's moves without knowing the exact steps/actions they are taking.

## What You'll Find Here
Trajectories: Dive into our collection of expert trajectories depicted solely by the states encountered.

Scripts : Contains scripts used to collect these expert trajectories, can be used for changing parameters according to your own needs. 

## How to Use 
In the `trajectories` directory, you will find the trajectories. Use `np.load` to use the trajectories for SOIL.
